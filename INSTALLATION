INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

    1. in CFL3D main directory, execute python configuration script source/configure.py with input parameters
        input parameters are: 
        [-h] [-b BUILD] [-c COMPILER] [-f] [-o] [-i] [-x]
       
        -b specifies name of directory where to build executables
       
        -c specifies version of compiler
       
        -f if build directory already exist, add any changes to it
       
        -o if build directory already exist, remove it and make new one

        -x specifies location where all executables will be copied during "make install" phase
           if not specified, location will be in build directory in subdirectory starting with
           machine platform name with bin subdirectory in it
       
        example: source/configure.py -b build -c gfortran -o
       
        specifies that CFL3D is going to be compiled in  CFL3D/buid directory, compilation will be using gfortran
        and if build already exist, delete and make a completely new directory
       
       
     2. enter directory and type make. This will compile entire code. If you intent to compile just part of code go to that directory
        and execute gmake there
       
       
    3. If cleaning everything, type gmake clean. If you intend to clean only part of project, go to that directory and execute
        gmake clean from there
       
       
DEVELOPMENT:

       Once you download the project, go to CFL3D directory and type   ./configure.py -i
       this will create a config.mk file. This  is done only once. If it happens that config.mk file is gone, ./configure.py -i again

       If any new routine is added, encapsulate it in module and use USE statement. You will need to recreate dependency file. To do so
       execute command "gmake depend" from CFL3D directory. If only part of project was modified, go to that directory and execute
       gmake clean from there.
       
NOTE:
       Makefiles for cflcmplx and preron  must be completed!!!!
